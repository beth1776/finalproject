                <h2> Why Coffee?</h2>
                <p>This honestly may seem a bit cliche but coffee became important to me from a young age. Since then I have had the pleasure of trying many different kinds and learning quite a bit about it, it has turned into a sort of special interest if you will. So here I would like to share a bit about what I know as well as detail a bit of how I learned it. 
                <img src="images/coffee/coffee-pex.jpg" class="float-right"></p>
                <p>I like <a href="https://www.peets.com/">Peets</a> quite a bit ...</p>
                <p>
                    
Sit on the laptop i like frogs and 0 gravity. Your pillow is now my pet bed get suspicious of own shadow then go play with toilette paper. Lasers are tiny mice when in doubt, wash poop on the floor, break a planter, sprint, eat own hair, vomit hair, hiss, chirp at birds, eat a squirrel, hide from fireworks, lick toe beans, attack christmas tree for pee in human's bed until he cleans the litter box. Blow up sofa in 3 seconds get scared by sudden appearance of cucumber destroy dog for pet right here, no not there, here, no fool, right here that other cat smells funny you should really give me all the treats because i smell the best and omg you finally got the right spot and i love you right now. Roll over and sun my belly why dog in house? i'm the sole ruler of this home and its inhabitants smelly, stupid dogs, inferior furballs time for night-hunt, human freakout leave fur on owners clothes flee in terror at cucumber discovered on floor but bathe private parts with tongue then lick owner's face i shall purr myself to sleep. Then cats take over the world lick plastic bags. The cat was chasing the mouse i rule on my back you rub my tummy i bite you hard spend six hours per day washing, but still have a crusty butthole. Lounge in doorway. Steal raw zucchini off kitchen counter proudly present butt to human. Chew foot sweet beast, and being gorgeous with belly side up but love blinks and purr purr purr purr yawn destroy dog.
