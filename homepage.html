                <h2> Why Coffee?</h2>
                <p>This honestly may seem a bit cliche but coffee became important to me from a young age. Since then I have had the pleasure of trying many different kinds and learning quite a bit about it, it has turned into a sort of special interest if you will. So here I would like to share a bit about what I know as well as detail a bit of how I learned it.</p>
